- ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! My name is Evgeny, a software engineer who likes cats, photography, and good food.
- ðŸ‘€ What I'm always looking for is an opportunity to make an impact. A service that makes someone's life better, a game that brings important thoughts, a video that helps productivity.
- ðŸŒ± I code in Kotlin and Java. But also had my hands on JS, Typescript, Python, C#
- ðŸŽ® I develop the game: started of on Godot, but moved to Unreal Engine. C++ had glowed up!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? Check this out: [My Links](https://linktr.ee/eignatik)
